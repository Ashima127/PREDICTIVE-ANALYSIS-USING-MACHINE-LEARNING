## Machine Learning Classification Model ##
This project demonstrates building a machine learning classification model to predict outcomes based on structured data. The notebook includes:

 Data loading and exploration

1 Feature selection

2 Model training using Logistic Regression

3 Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report)

4 Visualization and insights

The project uses Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn, and is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook.
